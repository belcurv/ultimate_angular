## What Problem is Angular trying to solve?

SPAs aim for improved user experience, but building SPAs with plain javascript is hard.

There are other frameworks: ReactJS Ember ViewJS.  Angular's been around for a while and has a lot of nice features.

**Features we need in a SPA:**

1.  HTTP communication with XHR.  Angular abstracts the complications away.
2.  DOM manipulation.  Angular employs jQLite for this.
3.  Managing State and Routing.  State drives page changes, Angular handles routing based on state and makes it a lot easier than wriing routing in plain JS or jQuery routing.  State also means fwd/back work normally, we can bookmark pages and copy/paste them elsewhere.  

## The Good and the Bad

**Upsides**

1.  Nice features (ex.: 2-way data binding)
2.  Large community
3.  Lots of open source tools and components
4.  Well proven in the real world
5.  Once proficient, you can be a more efficient / productive developer


**Downsides**

1.  Steep learning curve
2.  New terms and concepts
3.  There's often more than 1 way to do things
4.  Bad for SEO (a problem with SPAs in general)
5.  Poor performance in some circumstances

Many of these downsides are solved in Angular 2
